# Javascript Quiz Challenge

## Description
In this challenge, the task was to use javascript to allow the user to test their javascript knowledge with a quiz! When the start quiz button is clicked, the timer begins and the user gets their first question. The questions are random and when correct, it moves to the next question. When wrong, the timer loses 10 seconds. The quiz is over when the timer runs out or the questions are finished. I also added a highscore tab on the mainpage. I even managed to find a way to add sound! I still find JS quite difficult but the more I practice and read into it, the more familiar I become. 

## Installation
To install this, go to the repository located here https://github.com/mohammed45a/javascript-quiz On the page, press the green code button and copy the repository using the https or ssh. Then open your terminal and go to your file/folder where you want to clone it. Write git clone on terminal then paste the link and the clone should copy to your local machine.
